# Surfs_up

## Project Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary
Based on our analysis we can state that Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December, making a 0.5 difference between both seasons.

In addition, current data provide attributes such precipitation and others, with two queries that our analysis pursue, performing weather data for June and December. This helps to decide how we can provide W. Avy our analysis, to help build the shop and know what areas would make this location attractive to visitors.
